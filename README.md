# READ ME SOMETHING SHORT

Is a swiss-army tool for those people who want to summarize texts, articles or pdfs.

All you need to do is launch the main.py file and the webapp will be hosted locally on your machine and you can simply copy and paste articles or upload a file that you would like to have summarized. You can listen to the summary right on the web or listen to the downloaded version at your convinience. 

We are lucky enough to be assisted by the good folks at  Aflorithmic who helped us in the audio dep with their API and support.
